# polynomial
This program is a simple polynomial calculator that can add two polynomials and calculate the value of the resulting polynomial for a given value of x.

## Usage
The program will ask you to enter two polynomials, each separated by a + sign. You can enter the coefficients and exponents for each term of the polynomial using the x^ notation.
For example: 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 1.

Once you have entered the first and second polynomials, the program will display the sum of the two polynomials, and ask you to enter a value for x. The program will then calculate the value of the polynomial for that value of x and display the result.

You can continue entering new polynomials as many times as you like. To end the program, simply enter 0 when prompted for the first polynomial.
